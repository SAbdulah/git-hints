The easiest way is to create a ~/.netrc file with the following contents:

machine github.com
login YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
password YOUR_GITHUB_PASSWORD
(as shown here: https://gist.github.com/ahoward/2885020)

You can even close up the permissions on this file so that no one can read your password by typing:

chmod 600 ~/.netrc
